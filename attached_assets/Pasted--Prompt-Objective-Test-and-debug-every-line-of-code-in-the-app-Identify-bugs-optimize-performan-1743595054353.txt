Prompt:

Objective: Test and debug every line of code in the app. Identify bugs, optimize performance, and ensure that the app runs smoothly.
	1.	Initialize Debugging:
	•	Start by analyzing the codebase.
	•	Identify any potential errors, warnings, or inefficiencies across all files.
	2.	Function-Level Analysis:
	•	For each function or method, ensure that:
	•	The function logic is sound and correctly implemented.
	•	Variables are properly initialized and used.
	•	There are no dead code paths.
	•	Edge cases and input validation are properly handled.
	3.	Test Edge Cases:
	•	For each function, simulate edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, boundary conditions) and verify the behavior.
	•	Check for off-by-one errors, overflow issues, or unexpected behavior on extreme inputs.
	4.	Check Code Coverage:
	•	Verify that every line of the code is covered by tests. Generate missing tests if necessary.
	•	Run unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests (if applicable).
	5.	Optimize Performance:
	•	Review the code for performance bottlenecks, such as inefficient loops, excessive database calls, or unoptimized data structures.
	•	Suggest improvements for better memory management, speed, and responsiveness.
	6.	Error Handling and Logging:
	•	Ensure that the app has proper error handling for all possible exceptions.
	•	Review logging mechanisms to ensure informative logs without unnecessary verbosity.
	7.	Review Dependencies:
	•	Ensure that external libraries and packages are correctly installed, updated, and used efficiently.
	•	Remove any unused or redundant dependencies.
	8.	Cross-Platform Testing:
	•	Verify the app’s behavior across different environments (e.g., different operating systems, browsers, or devices if applicable).
	9.	Security Check:
	•	Review the code for security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and others.
	•	Ensure sensitive data is properly protected.
	10.	Generate Debugging Report:
	•	After performing the above tasks, generate a detailed debugging report with identified issues, suggested fixes, and performance metrics.
